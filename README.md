Residency Match Problem, brute forcing based on preference

For this assignment, I had to make a brute force algorithm to match residents to hospitals based on preference for both the hostipal and the patient. The reason i am proud of this assignment is because I struggled heavily with this assignment early on, not understanding how exactly to brute force the problem. Through some hard work and dedication to get this done, I was able to get 100% on this assignment by myself, putting in a new confidence in my coding abilities and my determination to solve a problem and learn something out of the problem.
